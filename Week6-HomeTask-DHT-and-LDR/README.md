# üå°Ô∏è ESP32 Environment Monitor (DHT11 + LDR + OLED)

### üìò Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **simple IoT environment monitoring system** using the **ESP32** microcontroller.  
It reads **temperature**, **humidity**, and **light intensity** values from sensors and displays them on an **OLED screen**.

---

### üß† Features
- Reads **temperature & humidity** via DHT11 sensor  
- Measures **ambient light** using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)  
- Displays live readings on a **0.96‚Äù OLED (SSD1306)**  
- Prints data on **Serial Monitor** for debugging  
- Uses **I2C communication** for display connection

### üß© Working Principle
1. The **DHT11** sensor reads **temperature** and **humidity** values.
2. The **LDR** detects **light intensity** by converting brightness into resistance, read via ADC.
3. The **ESP32** processes and displays the data on the **OLED** and **Serial Monitor**.
4. The voltage from the LDR is calculated to understand light level changes.
