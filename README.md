# Embedded IoT Systems

This repository showcases practical work developed as part of an **Embedded IoT Systems** course.  
It demonstrates core concepts of embedded programming and Internet of Things (IoT) using **ESP32 and Arduino** platforms through hands-on projects and assignments.

## 🔍 Overview

The repository is designed to provide a consolidated view of how embedded systems interact with sensors, actuators, displays, and network connectivity to build real-world IoT solutions.

Rather than focusing on individual lectures, the codebase collectively demonstrates:
- Embedded system fundamentals  
- Sensor data acquisition  
- Actuator control  
- Display interfacing  
- Wireless communication and IoT concepts  

## 🚀 Key Demonstrations

Across the repository, you will find implementations of:

- **Microcontroller programming** using ESP32 and Arduino  
- **Sensor integration** (temperature, humidity, light intensity)  
- **Actuator control** (LEDs, buzzers, relays, motors)  
- **OLED display interfacing** for real-time data visualization  
- **Timers and interrupts** for precise task scheduling  
- **Wi-Fi communication** and basic web/IoT interaction  
- **Complete IoT projects**, such as a Smart Aquarium system  

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
