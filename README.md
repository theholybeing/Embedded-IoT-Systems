# Embedded IoT Systems Projects

This repository contains multiple projects developed for the **Embedded IoT Systems** course.  
Each project demonstrates the use of microcontrollers like **ESP32** and **Arduino** with various sensors, actuators, and displays.

## Projects

- **LED Controller** – Control multiple LEDs with different modes using push buttons and a buzzer.  
- **Sensor Integration** – Read temperature, humidity, and light intensity using DHT and LDR sensors.  
- **Environment Monitor** – Display real-time environmental data on an OLED screen.  
- **OLED Interface** – Create user interfaces on OLED displays using Adafruit libraries.

## Hardware Used

- ESP32 / Arduino  
- DHT11 / DHT22 Sensor  
- LDR Sensor  
- OLED Display (SSD1306)  
- LEDs, Buzzer, Push Buttons  
- Jumper Wires, Breadboard

## Tools

- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO  
- Wokwi Simulator  
- Visual Studio Code
